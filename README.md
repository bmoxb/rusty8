# rusty8

`rusty8` is a simple Chip-8 emulator implemented in Rust with [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) used for rendering and sound.

The code is designed to be simple and succinct. The full source code is across just 2 files with < 400 lines of code total excluding comments and whitespace.

## Usage

The path of the ROM to execute should be passed as the only command-line argument to the emulator.

The following keyboard keys are passed as input to running games: 1, 2, 3, 4, Q, W, E, R, A, S, D, F, Z, X, C, V.

The emulator is exited by simply closing the game window.
